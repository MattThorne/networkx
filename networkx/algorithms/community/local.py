Local Community Detection Algorithms

Local Community Detection (LCD) aims to detected one or a few communities
starting from certain source nodes in the network. This differs from Global
Communty Detection (GCD), which aims to partition an entire network into
communities.

LCD is often useful when only a portion of the graph is known or the
graph is large enough that GCD is infeasable

[1]_ Gives a good introduction and overview of LCD

def clauset_greedy_source_expansion(G, *, source, cutoff=None):
    r"""Find the local community around a source node.

    Find the local community around a source node using the Greedy Source
    Expansion algorithm as described by Clauset [1]_. The algorithm identifies a
    local community starting from the source node and expands it based on the
    local modularity gain at each step. The algorithm adds neighboring nodes
    that maximize local modularity to the community iteratively, stopping when
    no additional nodes improve the modularity or when a predefined cutoff is
    reached.

    Local modularity measures the density of edges within a community relative
    to the total graph. By focusing on local modularity, the algorithm efficiently
    uncovers communities around a specific node without requiring global
    optimization over the entire graph.

    The algorithm assumes that the graph $G$ consists of a known community $C$ and
    an unknown set of nodes $U$, which are adjacent to $C$ . The boundary of the
    community $B$, consists of nodes in $C$ that have at least one neighbor in $U$.

    Mathematically, the local modularity is expressed as:

    .. math::
        R = \frac{I}{T}

    where $T$ is the number of edges with one or more endpoints in $B$, and $I$ is the
    number of those edges with neither endpoint in $U$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The input graph.

    source : node
        The source node from which the community expansion begins.

    cutoff : int, optional (default=None)
        The maximum number of nodes to include in the community. If None, the algorithm
        expands until no further modularity gain can be made.

    Returns
    -------
    set
        A set of nodes representing the local community around the source node.

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()
    >>> nx.community.clauset_greedy_source_expansion(G, source=16)
    {16, 0, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11}

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm is designed for detecting local communities around a specific node,
    which is useful for large networks where global community detection is computationally
    expensive. The method follows the local modularity optimization framework introduced
    by Clauset [1]_.

    The result of the algorithm may vary based on the structure of the graph, the choice of
    the source node, and the presence of ties between nodes during the greedy expansion process.
